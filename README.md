# Mask Detection 

In the times of COVID-19, the aim of this project is to help support the awareness of wearing masks aroud the world. The system detects if the person is wearing/not wearing a mask.
We have used TensorFlow.js and Keras to train a CNN model. It is free for anyone to try out!

## Applications

The system works in real-time and is great for integration with surveillance systems at public places. It is also a great learning resource.

## Dataset

We have used the open Medical Masks Dataset by Eden Social Welfare Foundation, Taiwan [https://www.kaggle.com/vtech6/medical-masks-dataset]

## Results

Here we have attached a few training and testing graphs:

### Accuracy Per Class
